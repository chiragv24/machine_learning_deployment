# machine_learning_deployment

Repository for ML Model Deployment Course

Course Objectives:

Learn how to use tools to put models into production (Docker, Heroku)
Practice deploying models beyond theoretical concepts

Why:

To date, only 1 production model deployed in job, but this was using simple tools abstracting the under the hood work of deployment
Become a more well rounded Data Scientist and opening up potential for new roles like Machine Learning Engineering
